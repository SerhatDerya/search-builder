# Privacy Policy for Search Builder

**Last updated:** February 1, 2026

Search Builder is a browser extension built with a single purpose: helping users create precise Google searches and find exactly what they need anywhere online.

## 1. Data We Collect
Search Builder does **not** collect, transmit, or sell any personal information.

The extension does not collect:
- Names, email addresses, or account information  
- Browsing history or visited websites  
- Cookies or authentication data  
- Financial or health information  
- Any background browsing activity  

The extension only processes the search terms and filters that the user explicitly enters in the extension interface.

## 2. Saved Searches (Local Storage Only)
Search Builder provides an optional feature that allows users to save search queries for later reuse.

If you choose to save searches:
- They are stored **locally in your browser** using the Chrome `storage` API  
- They remain on your device  
- They are **not** transmitted to any external server  
- They can be deleted at any time by the user within the extension

## 3. How We Use Data
Any user input is used only to provide the extension’s core functionality:
- Building advanced Google search queries  
- Allowing users to reuse saved searches  
- Improving search precision and reducing irrelevant results  

Search Builder does not use user data for advertising, analytics, tracking, or marketing purposes.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
Search Builder does **not** share, sell, or transfer user data to any third parties.

No user data is shared with:
- Advertisers  
- Analytics providers  
- External services  
- The developer or any human reviewer  

All saved queries stay entirely on the user’s device.

## 5. Permissions Justification
Search Builder requests only the minimum permissions required:
- **storage**: Used to save user-created searches locally for later reuse.
- **tabs**: Used to open Google search results in a new tab when the user runs a query.

These permissions are used strictly for user-facing features described in the extension.

## 6. Security
Search Builder does not transmit personal or sensitive user data over the network.
Since all saved searches remain stored locally, no encryption or remote transmission is required.

## 7. Limited Use Compliance
Search Builder complies with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy and Limited Use requirements.
User data is used only to provide the extension’s single purpose and is never accessed by humans, monetized, or used for unrelated purposes.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
If the extension’s functionality changes in a way that affects user data handling, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
